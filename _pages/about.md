# About me:
Welcome to my homepage! I am **Ying Cui (崔滢)**, currently a Ph.D. candidate at **UCLA Mechanical Engineering**, supervised by Prof. [Yongjie Hu](http://hu.seas.ucla.edu/). 
My research lies in the intersection of **Heat Transfer, Semiconductor and Biology**. 
I am always interested in research collaborations and looking for a faculty position at mechanical engineering. 

# Research interests:
- **Thermal Management** in Semiconductor, Electronics, Energy and Personal
- **Micro/nano Heat Transfer in Biology**: Cellular, Tissue, Biomedical and Healthcare
- **Bioispired Materials**: multifunction, multiscale, and sustainability
- **AI/ML-based Thermal Bioimaging**
